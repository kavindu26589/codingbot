# Coding Bot

A Flask-based backend that leverages the Hugging Face Inference API for creative text generation and automatic speech recognition (ASR) using the Microsoft Phi-4 multimodal instruct model. This project is designed to work in GitHub Codespaces and can be integrated with a GitHub Pages frontend.

## Overview

This project provides two primary API endpoints:

- **/generate:** Accepts a text prompt and returns creative text generated by the Phi-4 model.
- **/asr:** Accepts an audio file and returns its transcription.

The backend is configured to run over HTTPS (using an ad-hoc SSL context) to ensure secure communication with frontends served over HTTPS (e.g., GitHub Pages).

## Features

- **Creative Text Generation:**  
  Generate creative outputs using a fine-tuned multimodal model.
- **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR):**  
  Transcribe audio files using the same model.
- **Hugging Face Inference API Integration:**  
  No local model downloads are requiredâ€”the app calls the Hugging Face Inference API directly.
- **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):**  
  The backend is CORS-enabled, allowing communication from different origins.

## Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- Dependencies (install via pip):
  - `flask`
  - `flask-cors`
  - `requests`
  - `cryptography`

You can install the required packages using:

```bash
pip install flask flask-cors requests cryptography

git clone https://github.com/your-username/creative-coding-bot.git
cd creative-coding-bot/backend
